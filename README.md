# Splicing Toolkit

## Purpose
The goal of the `splicing_toolkit` package is to make performing splicing classification on long read sequencing data simpler and easily repreducible. The current package consists of two functions stored in `utils.py`, but I am working on creating a CLI that allows for easy access to those utility functions, among others that will assist with UTR exploration and polyadenylation.

## Functions

`splicing_classifier(LRS_url, output_save)`
This function takes the three bed files generated by `gtf_to_bed12` and the path to the long read sequencing data (`LRS_url`) and generates a file that classifies the splicing status for each of the reads in the LRS data. 

This repo is under construction!!
